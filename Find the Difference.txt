Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

Solution:

def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        s=list(s)
        t=list(t)
        s.sort()
        t.sort()
        c=0
        if(len(t)>len(s)):
            for i in range(len(s)):
                if(t[i]!=s[i]):
                    return t[i]
            return t[len(t)-1]
        else:
            for i in range(len(t)):
                if(s[i]!=t[i]):
                    return s[i]
            return s[len(s)-1]
